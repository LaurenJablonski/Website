      <h1> An example of some html</h1>
      <h2> Headings and paragraphs (this is an h2 heading</h2>
      <p> In HTML headings are marked with using heading tags such h1. There are six levels of heading supported. The biggest is h1 which is used for page titles. The smallest is h6. On most pages you probably won't see h4-6 used.
      </p>

      <p>
      	Paragraphs are separated using p tags. This automatically separates them into blocks, leaving a gap in between.
      </p>

      <p>
      	Within a paragraph you can make text bold or italic. In fact it's probably bad to think of these as bold and italic - instead you should genuinely consider them as 'strong' and 'emphasised' - you can decide exactly how to display them in you css, bold and italic are just the defaults. This is an example of symantic markup: you're adding information as to the interpretation of certain words, rather than dictating how they should be displayed.
      </p>

      <h2> Blank lines and void tags </h2>
      <p> 
      	It is also possible to insert extra blank lines manually using the br tag. The br tag is a special type of tag (called a 'void tag'); you don't need a closing br tag, just un opening one.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>
      	You can write comments in your html code, which won't be displayedin the browser.
      </p>
      <!--- This is a comment. It won't show up in the page, but you will be able to see it if you view the page source (be warned!) -->
      <h2> Lists </h2>
      <p> Html has two basic types of list:</p>
      <ol>
      	1.Ordered lists - displays a numbered list </br>
      	2.Unordered lists - displays a list of bullet points
      </ol>
      <p> Both have the same basic structure. </p>
      <ul>
      	An opening list tag</br>
      	Many list items using the li tag </br>
      	A closing list tags
      </ul>
      <p>
      	You don't often see lists in their basic form, but lists are heavily used in websites; dropdown menus are often cleverly styled lists.
      </p>
      <h2>
      	Links
      </h2>
      <p>
      	This section is about making your page interactive and allowing users to reach another website through your page. Click
      	<a href = 
      	"https://www.bbc.co.uk ">here</a> to go to BBC.
      	<h2>
      		Images
      	</h2>
      	<p>
      		Images are a bit like links. You specify the location of the image with the 'src' property in the img tag.(Like you give the exact route how you went through your files to get to the documents).
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		Note that img tags are like br tags: they don't come in pairs. The 'alt' property should be used to provide a description of the image in case it won't load or the user is partially sighted.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      	Images can be stored on the same host ... 
      	</p>
      	<img alt ="A local image" src="./local_image.png"></img>
      	<p> ... or on another server entirely.</p>
      	<img alt="A picture of a cat." src="http://jerrymahoney.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/kitten.jpg"></img>
      	<h2>
      		Tables
      	</h2>
      	<p>
      		Tables are used for holding data
      	</p>
      	<table class >

      			<th>College</th>
